### HTML

Errors were returned when using W3C validator - all errors were amended and none remain.

### CSS

No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator - please see link [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2F8000-megc92-v2personal-traini-5iv6y06879.us2.codeanyapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

## Unfixed Bugs

- HTML Validator error RE: charset UTF-8 remains unfixed as unsure what is wrong with this and does not appear to impact functionality of website.
- I had significant difficulty using CodeAnywhere IDE (first time using an IDE) which resulted in me having to make several new workspaces when the original workspaces stopped working for me. As I would progress to such a stage in one workspace with some code - I would copy that successful code over to the succesful workspace. As such, my commit history on this repository is not as clear or detailed as I would have liked.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. On the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. On lefthand side of page - navigate to Pages
3. The source was set to 'Deploy from a branch'
4. Once selected, the 'main' branch was then selected and saved
5. The live link can be found here - https://megc92.github.io/v2personal-training/
